# South-Park-Animation-Studio
This Windows application is a South Park animation studio, with the addition of a South Park Stylized Sparty and an apple tree that
grows throughout the animation. This tree can be seeded such that the same tree grows every time depending on the seed. The trees can also 
bend based on a wind speed toggle which relates to how significantly the tree bends, and apples can be harvested into a basket, as well. When 
creating an animation, characters and their body parts can be moved around, and once an animation sequence is complete, it can be saved and 
loaded back in at a later time to be viewed again.

# The application
The TreeLib and TreeDemo were mainly implemented by me. The bulk of the project was focused on implementing these for a randomly generated
apple tree that can grow based on the seed provided, an adapter that can translate the projects for the canadian experience, and creating
a saving mechanism so that animations created can be saved and loaded back in later for viewing.

The CandianExperience, while the files were provided by our professor for this project, most of the files were implemented or worked on by me in previous 
assignments, either through a tutorial that helped guide me or through tasks that were left to for me to solve, such as intepolation between frames
and handling animation keyframes. The solution was provided simply so students who didn't complete those assingments were not at a disadvantage for the
class project
